### Hi there üëã

My name is Killian and I am currently studying Software Engineering at Concordia University. While finishing my studies I am also working at [Lem√©ac](https://www.restaurantlemeac.com/) as a server. I am a fanatic about software architecture, learning about software systems and using clean code methodologies. I love network programming, distributed systems, clever cli programs, web applications and staying informed about what is going on in the tech world. I often create side projects to learn new languages or frameworks, though I do not always push them to my repo. üòê

I am currently looking to find an internship as a Software Engineer for the summer 2023.
